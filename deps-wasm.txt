# WebAssembly-compatible versions for GEGL dependencies
# This file lists versions of GEGL dependencies that are compatible with WebAssembly compilation using Emscripten

## Core Required Dependencies

### BABL (Pixel format conversion library)
- Version: >= 0.1.112
- WASM compatibility: Must be compiled with Emscripten
- Alternative: None (core dependency for GEGL's pixel processing)
- Notes: Required for all GEGL operations. Cannot be disabled.

### GLib (Core utility library)
- Version: >= 2.44.0
- WASM compatibility: Must be compiled with Emscripten
- Alternative: None (fundamental dependency for GObject system)
- Notes: Required for GObject-based architecture. Cannot be disabled.

### JSON-GLib (JSON processing library)
- Version: >= 1.0.0
- WASM compatibility: Must be compiled with Emscripten
- Alternative: Consider cJSON or rapidjson for lighter JSON handling
- Notes: Used for operation metadata and configuration. Can be disabled initially for minimal builds.

## Initially Disabled Dependencies (for minimal WASM builds)

The following dependencies are disabled in meson-wasm.build for WASM builds:
- g-ir (GObject Introspection) - Not needed for runtime
- vapigen (Vala bindings) - Not needed for runtime
- gexiv2 (EXIF metadata) - Disabled for WASM
- libpng, libjpeg - Image I/O operations disabled
- cairo, pango - 2D graphics operations disabled
- OpenCL - Not applicable for WebAssembly
- SDL, FFmpeg - Multimedia operations disabled
- And many others...

## Building Dependencies for WASM

All dependencies must be compiled with Emscripten using:
- emconfigure ./configure
- emmake make

Or using Meson with appropriate cross-compilation files.

## Notes on WASM-specific considerations

- Threading support (gthread) is replaced with wasm-threading.c
- File system operations are limited to Emscripten's virtual FS
- Some GLib features may need to be disabled for WASM compatibility
- Memory management uses Emscripten's malloc implementation
